    <h1>How to Make Fettuccine: A Step-by-Step Guide</h1>
    <p>Fettuccine, a classic Italian pasta, is loved for its thick, flat noodles that pair perfectly with rich, creamy sauces. Whether you’re a seasoned chef or a beginner in the kitchen, making fettuccine from scratch is a rewarding experience. In this blog post, I’ll guide you through the process step by step.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <div class="ingredients">
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>Water (as needed)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Step 1: Gather Your Ingredients and Tools</h2>
    <p>Before you start, gather all your ingredients and tools. You’ll need a large mixing bowl, a fork or whisk, a rolling pin, a knife or pasta cutter, and a large pot for boiling water.</p>

    <h2>Step 2: Make the Dough</h2>
    <div class="steps">
        <ul>
            <li>Form a Well: On a clean work surface or in a large mixing bowl, pile the flour and create a well in the center. Crack the eggs into the well, add the olive oil and salt.</li>
            <li>Mix the Dough: Using a fork or your fingers, gently beat the eggs, gradually incorporating the flour from the edges of the well. Continue mixing until the dough starts to come together.</li>
            <li>Knead the Dough: Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead for about 8-10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. If the dough is too dry, add water a teaspoon at a time. If it’s too sticky, add a bit more flour.</li>
            <li>Rest the Dough: Wrap the dough in plastic wrap or cover it with a damp cloth. Let it rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. This allows the gluten to relax and makes the dough easier to roll out.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Step 3: Roll Out the Dough</h2>
    <div class="steps">
        <ul>
            <li>Divide the Dough: Cut the dough into 2-4 equal pieces. Work with one piece at a time, keeping the remaining pieces covered to prevent them from drying out.</li>
            <li>Flatten the Dough: On a lightly floured surface, use a rolling pin to flatten the dough into a rough rectangle.</li>
            <li>Roll the Dough: Continue rolling the dough, flipping and rotating it frequently to maintain an even thickness. Aim for a thickness of about 1/8 inch (3 mm).</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Step 4: Cut the Fettuccine</h2>
    <div class="steps">
        <ul>
            <li>Fold and Cut: Lightly dust the rolled-out dough with flour. Fold it into thirds or roll it up loosely. Using a sharp knife or pasta cutter, slice the dough into strips about 1/4 inch (6 mm) wide.</li>
            <li>Unfold the Noodles: Unfold the cut noodles and lay them out on a floured surface or hang them on a pasta drying rack.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Step 5: Cook the Fettuccine</h2>
    <div class="steps">
        <ul>
            <li>Boil Water: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.</li>
            <li>Cook the Pasta: Add the fettuccine to the boiling water. Fresh pasta cooks quickly, usually in about 2-3 minutes. Test for doneness by tasting a noodle; it should be tender but still slightly firm (al dente).</li>
            <li>Drain the Pasta: Once cooked, drain the fettuccine in a colander.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Step 6: Serve</h2>
    <div class="steps">
        <ul>
            <li>Choose a Sauce: Fettuccine pairs well with a variety of sauces, such as Alfredo, Bolognese, or a simple garlic and olive oil sauce.</li>
            <li>Toss and Serve: Toss the cooked fettuccine with your chosen sauce in a large pan over low heat. Ensure the pasta is evenly coated.</li>
            <li>Garnish and Enjoy: Transfer the fettuccine to a serving dish. Garnish with freshly grated Parmesan cheese, chopped parsley, or a drizzle of olive oil. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p>Making fettuccine from scratch is a delightful culinary adventure. Follow these steps, and you’ll create delicious, homemade pasta that’s sure to impress. Buon appetito!</p>
