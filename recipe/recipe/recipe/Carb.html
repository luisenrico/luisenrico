    <h1>How to Make Carbonara: A Step-by-Step Guide</h1>
    <p>Carbonara is a classic Italian pasta dish known for its creamy, rich sauce made with eggs, cheese, pancetta, and pepper. Despite its luxurious taste, Carbonara is simple to prepare with just a few key ingredients. In this blog post, I’ll guide you through the process step by step.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <div class="ingredients">
        <ul>
            <li>200g spaghetti or fettuccine</li>
            <li>100g pancetta or guanciale, diced</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup grated Parmesan or Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, peeled and left whole</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Fresh parsley (optional, for garnish)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Step 1: Gather Your Ingredients and Tools</h2>
    <p>Before you start, gather all your ingredients and tools. You’ll need a large pot for boiling water, a skillet for cooking the pancetta, a mixing bowl, a whisk or fork, and a ladle for pasta water.</p>

    <h2>Step 2: Prepare the Cheese and Egg Mixture</h2>
    <div class="steps">
        <ul>
            <li>Grate the Cheese: Grate the Parmesan or Pecorino Romano cheese if it’s not pre-grated.</li>
            <li>Whisk the Eggs: In a mixing bowl, whisk the eggs until smooth. Add most of the grated cheese (reserve some for garnish) and a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper. Mix until well combined.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Step 3: Cook the Pasta</h2>
    <div class="steps">
        <ul>
            <li>Boil Water: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.</li>
            <li>Cook the Pasta: Add the spaghetti or fettuccine to the boiling water and cook until al dente, according to the package instructions.</li>
            <li>Reserve Pasta Water: Before draining the pasta, reserve about a cup of the starchy pasta water.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Step 4: Cook the Pancetta</h2>
    <div class="steps">
        <ul>
            <li>Heat the Skillet: While the pasta is cooking, heat a skillet over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Cook the Pancetta: Add the diced pancetta or guanciale to the skillet and cook until it’s crispy and the fat has rendered out, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add Garlic: Add the whole garlic cloves to the skillet with the pancetta to infuse the oil with garlic flavor. Remove the garlic cloves once they are golden brown and fragrant.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Step 5: Combine Pasta and Pancetta</h2>
    <div class="steps">
        <ul>
            <li>Add Pasta to Skillet: Once the pasta is cooked, drain it and immediately add it to the skillet with the pancetta. Toss well to combine, ensuring the pasta is coated with the rendered fat.</li>
            <li>Remove from Heat: Remove the skillet from the heat to prevent the eggs from scrambling in the next step.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Step 6: Add the Egg and Cheese Mixture</h2>
    <div class="steps">
        <ul>
            <li>Mix Quickly: Pour the egg and cheese mixture over the hot pasta, tossing quickly to create a creamy sauce. The residual heat from the pasta will cook the eggs gently, creating a smooth, silky texture.</li>
            <li>Adjust Consistency: If the sauce is too thick, add a splash of the reserved pasta water, a little at a time, until you reach the desired consistency.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Step 7: Serve</h2>
    <div class="steps">
        <ul>
            <li>Plate the Pasta: Divide the Carbonara among serving plates.</li>
            <li>Garnish: Sprinkle with the remaining grated cheese and a bit more freshly ground black pepper. Garnish with fresh parsley if desired.</li>
            <li>Enjoy: Serve immediately and enjoy your delicious, homemade Carbonara.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p>Carbonara is a quick and satisfying dish that's perfect for any pasta lover. With these simple steps, you can recreate this classic Italian recipe at home and impress your family and friends. Buon appetito!</p>
