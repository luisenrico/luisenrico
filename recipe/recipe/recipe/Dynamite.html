    <h1>How to Make Dynamite Lumpia: A Step-by-Step Guide</h1>
    <p>Dynamite Lumpia are spicy and delicious snacks that are perfect for parties or gatherings. Here’s how you can make them at home:</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <div class="ingredients">
        <ul>
            <li>10-12 large green chili peppers (such as Anaheim or jalapeño peppers)</li>
            <li>100 grams ground pork or ground chicken</li>
            <li>50 grams cheese (cheddar or mozzarella), cut into thin strips</li>
            <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>Spring roll wrappers (lumpia wrappers)</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil, for frying</li>
            <li>Toothpicks or skewers, for securing</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Step 1: Prepare the Chili Peppers</h2>
    <div class="steps">
        <ul>
            <li>Prepare Peppers: Wash the chili peppers thoroughly. Make a lengthwise slit on one side of each pepper, starting from the stem down to the tip. Remove the seeds and membranes using a small spoon or knife, taking care to keep the peppers intact.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Step 2: Prepare the Filling</h2>
    <div class="steps">
        <ul>
            <li>Cook Filling: In a skillet or frying pan, heat a small amount of oil over medium heat. Sauté chopped onions and minced garlic until translucent and fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add Ground Meat: Add ground pork or chicken to the skillet. Cook until the meat is fully browned and cooked through, breaking it up into smaller pieces with a spatula.</li>
            <li>Season: Season with salt and pepper to taste. Remove from heat and let the filling cool slightly.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Step 3: Stuff the Peppers</h2>
    <div class="steps">
        <ul>
            <li>Fill Peppers: Using a small spoon or your fingers, stuff each chili pepper with the cooked meat mixture. Insert a strip of cheese into the center of each pepper.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Step 4: Wrap with Spring Roll Wrappers</h2>
    <div class="steps">
        <ul>
            <li>Wrap Peppers: Carefully wrap each stuffed chili pepper with a spring roll wrapper, making sure to seal the edges with a bit of water to prevent the filling from leaking out.</li>
            <li>Secure with Toothpicks: Secure the ends of the spring roll wrappers with toothpicks or skewers to keep them closed and secure.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Step 5: Fry the Dynamite Lumpia</h2>
    <div class="steps">
        <ul>
            <li>Heat Oil: In a deep frying pan or pot, heat enough vegetable oil over medium-high heat for deep-frying (around 2 inches deep).</li>
            <li>Fry Dynamite Lumpia: Carefully place the wrapped chili peppers in the hot oil, a few at a time, depending on the size of your frying pan. Fry until the spring roll wrappers are golden brown and crispy, turning occasionally to ensure even cooking.</li>
            <li>Drain: Remove the fried Dynamite Lumpia from the oil using a slotted spoon or tongs. Drain on paper towels to remove excess oil.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Step 6: Serve</h2>
    <div class="steps">
        <ul>
            <li>Serve Hot: Serve Dynamite Lumpia hot as an appetizer or snack. Remove the toothpicks or skewers before serving.</li>
            <li>Dip: Serve with your favorite dipping sauce, such as sweet chili sauce or vinegar with garlic and onions.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p>Enjoy your homemade Dynamite Lumpia, filled with spicy peppers and savory filling wrapped in crispy spring roll wrappers!</p>
