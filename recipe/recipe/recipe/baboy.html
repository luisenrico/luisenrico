            <li>500 grams pork belly or pork ribs, cut into chunks</li>
            <li>1 onion, peeled and quartered</li>
            <li>2 tomatoes, quartered</li>
            <li>2-3 pieces potatoes, peeled and quartered</li>
            <li>1 medium-sized sweet corn, cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
            <li>1/4 small cabbage, quartered</li>
            <li>1 bundle pechay or bok choy, separated</li>
            <li>Fish sauce (patis), to taste</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>Water, enough to cover all ingredients</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="steps">
        <h2>Step 1: Prepare the Pork and Vegetables</h2>
        <p><strong>Prepare Pork:</strong> Cut the pork belly or pork ribs into chunks. Rinse under cold water and drain.</p>
        <p><strong>Prepare Vegetables:</strong> Peel and quarter the onion. Quarter the tomatoes. Peel and quarter the potatoes. Cut the sweet corn into 2-inch pieces. Quarter the cabbage. Separate the leaves of pechay or bok choy.</p>

        <h2>Step 2: Boil Water and Add Pork</h2>
        <p><strong>Boil Water:</strong> In a large pot, pour enough water to cover the pork and vegetables. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.</p>
        <p><strong>Add Pork:</strong> Once boiling, add the pork chunks to the pot. Skim off any scum that rises to the surface.</p>

        <h2>Step 3: Simmer and Add Vegetables</h2>
        <p><strong>Simmer:</strong> Reduce the heat to medium-low and let the pork simmer for about 30 minutes, or until tender.</p>
        <p><strong>Add Vegetables:</strong> Add the quartered onion and tomatoes to the pot. Continue to simmer for another 5-10 minutes until the vegetables start to soften.</p>

        <h2>Step 4: Add Potatoes and Corn</h2>
        <p><strong>Add Potatoes and Corn:</strong> Add the quartered potatoes and pieces of sweet corn to the pot. Simmer for another 10-15 minutes, or until the potatoes are fork-tender.</p>

        <h2>Step 5: Season and Add Leafy Vegetables</h2>
        <p><strong>Season:</strong> Season with fish sauce (patis), salt, and pepper to taste. Adjust the seasoning according to your preference.</p>
        <p><strong>Add Leafy Vegetables:</strong> Add the quartered cabbage and separated pechay or bok choy leaves to the pot. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes until the vegetables are just wilted.</p>

        <h2>Step 6: Serve</h2>
        <p><strong>Serve Hot:</strong> Remove the pot from heat. Serve Nilagang Baboy hot in bowls, with steamed rice on the side if desired.</p>

    <div class="tips">
        <h2>Tips:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Variations:</strong> You can add other vegetables like green beans, carrots, or even plantains (saging na saba) for added sweetness.</li>
            <li><strong>Broth:</strong> The broth of Nilagang Baboy is flavorful on its own, but you can enhance it with a squeeze of calamansi juice or a dash of patis before serving.</li>
            <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on the stove or in the microwave before serving.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Enjoy your homemade Nilagang Baboy, a comforting and wholesome Filipino soup that’s perfect for family meals and gatherings!</p>
