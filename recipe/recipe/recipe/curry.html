            <li>Fresh cilantro, chopped (for garnish)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Step 1: Marinate the Chicken</h2>
    <div class="steps">
        <ul>
            <li>Prepare the Marinade: In a mixing bowl, combine the yogurt, lemon juice, ground cumin, ground coriander, turmeric powder, chili powder, salt, and pepper. Mix well.</li>
            <li>Marinate the Chicken: Add the chicken pieces to the marinade, making sure each piece is well coated. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Step 2: Prepare the Curry Sauce</h2>
    <div class="steps">
        <ul>
            <li>Heat Oil: In a large skillet or pot, heat vegetable oil or ghee over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Sauté Aromatics: Add the chopped onion and sauté until softened and translucent, about 5-7 minutes. Add the minced garlic and grated ginger, and sauté for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add Spices: Stir in the ground cumin, ground coriander, turmeric powder, and chili powder. Cook the spices for about 1 minute until they become fragrant, stirring constantly to prevent burning.</li>
            <li>Add Tomatoes: Add the chopped tomatoes and tomato paste (if using). Cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes break down and the mixture thickens slightly.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Step 3: Cook the Chicken</h2>
    <div class="steps">
        <ul>
            <li>Add Chicken: Add the marinated chicken pieces to the skillet, along with any remaining marinade. Stir well to coat the chicken in the spice mixture.</li>
            <li>Simmer: Cook the chicken for 8-10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it is cooked through and tender.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Step 4: Finish the Curry</h2>
    <div class="steps">
        <ul>
            <li>Add Coconut Milk or Cream: Pour in the coconut milk or heavy cream, stirring gently to combine. Bring the curry to a simmer and cook for another 5-7 minutes to allow the flavors to meld and the sauce to thicken slightly.</li>
            <li>Adjust Seasoning: Taste the curry and adjust the salt and chili powder as needed to suit your preference.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Step 5: Serve</h2>
    <div class="steps">
        <ul>
            <li>Garnish: Remove the curry from heat. Garnish with freshly chopped cilantro for added freshness and flavor.</li>
            <li>Serve: Serve the chicken curry hot, accompanied by steamed rice, naan bread, or your favorite side dishes.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
