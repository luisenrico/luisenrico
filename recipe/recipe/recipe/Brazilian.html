    <h1>How to Make Brazilian Rice: A Step-by-Step Guide</h1>
    <p>Rice is a staple in Brazilian cuisine, often served as a side dish to complement a variety of main courses. Brazilian rice is known for its unique flavor and fluffy texture. In this blog post, I’ll walk you through the process of making this delicious dish step by step.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <div class="ingredients">
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup of long-grain white rice</li>
            <li>2 cups of water</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of vegetable oil or olive oil</li>
            <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
            <li>Fresh parsley or cilantro (optional, for garnish)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Step 1: Prepare Your Ingredients</h2>
    <p>Before you start cooking, gather and prepare all your ingredients. Finely chop the onion and mince the garlic. Measure out the rice, water, oil, and salt.</p>

    <h2>Step 2: Rinse the Rice</h2>
    <div class="steps">
        <ul>
            <li>Place the rice in a fine-mesh strainer and rinse it under cold running water. This step is essential to remove excess starch, which helps prevent the rice from becoming sticky. Rinse until the water runs clear.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Step 3: Sauté the Onion and Garlic</h2>
    <div class="steps">
        <ul>
            <li>Heat the oil in a medium-sized saucepan over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the chopped onion and sauté for about 2-3 minutes, or until it becomes translucent. Then, add the minced garlic and cook for another minute, stirring frequently to avoid burning.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Step 4: Toast the Rice</h2>
    <div class="steps">
        <ul>
            <li>Add the rinsed rice to the saucepan with the sautéed onion and garlic. Stir well to coat the rice grains with oil. Toast the rice for about 2-3 minutes, stirring constantly. This step enhances the flavor and helps achieve the desired texture.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Step 5: Add Water and Salt</h2>
    <div class="steps">
        <ul>
            <li>Pour the 2 cups of water into the saucepan with the rice. Add the salt and stir to combine. Increase the heat to high and bring the water to a boil.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Step 6: Simmer the Rice</h2>
    <div class="steps">
        <ul>
            <li>Once the water reaches a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover the saucepan with a tight-fitting lid, and let it simmer for about 15-18 minutes. Avoid lifting the lid during this time, as the steam is necessary for cooking the rice evenly.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Step 7: Fluff and Serve</h2>
    <div class="steps">
        <ul>
            <li>After 15-18 minutes, check the rice to ensure it’s fully cooked and the water is absorbed. If the rice is done, remove the saucepan from the heat and let it sit, covered, for another 5 minutes. This resting period allows the rice to finish steaming and become fluffy.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Step 8: Garnish and Enjoy</h2>
    <div class="steps">
        <ul>
            <li>Fluff the rice with a fork and transfer it to a serving dish. If desired, garnish with freshly chopped parsley or cilantro for an added burst of flavor and color. Serve your Brazilian rice alongside your favorite main dishes and enjoy!</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p>Making Brazilian rice is simple, yet it brings a delicious and authentic touch to your meals. Follow these steps, and you’ll have a perfect side dish that complements any Brazilian-inspired menu. Happy cooking!</p>
