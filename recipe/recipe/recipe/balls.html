            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>1/2 pound ground pork</li>
            <li>1/2 cup breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove, minced</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground allspice</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter (for frying)</li>
            <li>For the Gravy:</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 cups beef broth</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Step 1: Gather Your Ingredients and Tools</h2>
    <p>Before you start, gather all your ingredients and tools. You’ll need a large mixing bowl, a skillet, a baking sheet, a whisk, and a saucepan.</p>

    <h2>Step 2: Prepare the Meatballs</h2>
    <div class="steps">
        <ul>
            <li>Soak the Breadcrumbs: In a large mixing bowl, combine the breadcrumbs and milk. Let them soak for a few minutes until the breadcrumbs absorb the milk.</li>
            <li>Mix the Meatball Ingredients: Add the ground beef, ground pork, chopped onion, minced garlic, egg, ground allspice, ground nutmeg, salt, and pepper to the bowl with the soaked breadcrumbs. Mix everything together until well combined.</li>
            <li>Form the Meatballs: Using your hands, shape the mixture into small meatballs, about 1 inch in diameter. Place the formed meatballs on a baking sheet.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Step 3: Cook the Meatballs</h2>
    <div class="steps">
        <ul>
            <li>Heat the Skillet: In a large skillet, melt 2 tablespoons of butter over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Fry the Meatballs: Add the meatballs to the skillet in batches, being careful not to overcrowd the pan. Fry the meatballs until they are browned on all sides and cooked through, about 7-10 minutes. Transfer the cooked meatballs to a plate and cover them to keep warm.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Step 4: Make the Gravy</h2>
    <div class="steps">
        <ul>
            <li>Make a Roux: In the same skillet, melt 2 tablespoons of butter over medium heat. Once melted, add the flour and whisk continuously for about 2 minutes until the mixture turns golden brown.</li>
            <li>Add the Broth: Gradually whisk in the beef broth, making sure to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Continue to whisk until the sauce starts to thicken.</li>
            <li>Add the Cream and Seasonings: Stir in the heavy cream and soy sauce. Let the gravy simmer for a few minutes until it thickens to your desired consistency. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Step 5: Combine and Serve</h2>
    <div class="steps">
        <ul>
            <li>Return the Meatballs to the Gravy: Add the cooked meatballs back to the skillet with the gravy. Stir gently to coat the meatballs with the sauce and let them simmer for a few minutes to heat through.</li>
            <li>Serve: Serve the Swedish meatballs hot, garnished with fresh parsley if desired. They pair perfectly with mashed potatoes, lingonberry sauce, or noodles.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p>Making Swedish meatballs at home is a delightful experience, and the result is a comforting, delicious meal. Follow these steps, and you’ll have a dish that’s sure to impress. Enjoy your homemade Swedish meatballs!</p>
