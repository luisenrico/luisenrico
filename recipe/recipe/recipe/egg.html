    <h1>How to Make a Classic Egg Omelette: A Step-by-Step Guide</h1>
    <p>An omelette is a quick and versatile dish that can be customized with various fillings. This guide will walk you through making a basic egg omelette that you can easily adapt to your preferences.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <div class="ingredients">
        <ul>
            <li>2-3 large eggs</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>1-2 tablespoons butter or oil (for cooking)</li>
            <li>Optional fillings: grated cheese, diced vegetables (bell peppers, onions, tomatoes), cooked ham or bacon, spinach, mushrooms, herbs (such as parsley or chives)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Step 1: Prepare the Eggs</h2>
    <div class="steps">
        <ul>
            <li>Crack and Whisk: Crack the eggs into a bowl. Add a pinch of salt and a grind of black pepper. Whisk the eggs vigorously with a fork or whisk until the yolks and whites are fully combined and the mixture is frothy.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Step 2: Heat the Pan</h2>
    <div class="steps">
        <ul>
            <li>Preheat: Place a non-stick skillet or omelette pan over medium heat. Allow it to preheat for a minute or two.</li>
            <li>Add Butter or Oil: Add butter or oil to the skillet, swirling to coat the bottom evenly. Let the butter melt and heat until it begins to bubble slightly.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Step 3: Cook the Omelette</h2>
    <div class="steps">
        <ul>
            <li>Pour in Eggs: Pour the whisked eggs into the heated skillet.</li>
            <li>Scramble Slightly: As the edges start to set, use a spatula to gently push the cooked egg towards the center of the pan while tilting the skillet to let the uncooked egg flow to the edges.</li>
            <li>Add Fillings: Once the omelette is mostly set but still slightly runny on top, add your desired fillings evenly over one half of the omelette.</li>
            <li>Fold: Using the spatula, carefully fold the omelette in half to cover the fillings. Press down gently with the spatula to seal.</li>
            <li>Cook Through: Cook for another 1-2 minutes until the omelette is cooked through and the cheese, if using, is melted.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Step 4: Serve</h2>
    <div class="steps">
        <ul>
            <li>Slide and Plate: Slide the omelette onto a plate, folding it gently if needed.</li>
            <li>Garnish: Garnish with fresh herbs or a sprinkle of cheese if desired.</li>
            <li>Serve: Serve hot and enjoy your delicious, fluffy egg omelette!</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p>Making a basic egg omelette is quick and easy, and you can experiment with different fillings and toppings to suit your taste. Whether for breakfast, brunch, or a light dinner, a well-made omelette is always satisfying.</p>
