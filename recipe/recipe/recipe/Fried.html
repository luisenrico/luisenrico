      <h2>Steps:</h2>
      <h3>Step 1: Boil the Chicken</h3>
      <p>
        Prepare Chicken: Rinse the chicken pieces under cold water and pat them dry with paper towels.
      </p>
      <p>
        Boil Chicken: Place the chicken pieces in a large pot and add enough water to cover them. Season the water with salt, pepper, and any optional herbs or spices you prefer (like garlic cloves or bay leaves). Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat and let the chicken simmer for about 15-20 minutes, or until cooked through. The internal temperature should reach 165°F (75°C).
      </p>
      <p>
        Cool and Drain: Once cooked, remove the chicken pieces from the pot and let them cool slightly. Drain them well on a wire rack or paper towels to remove excess moisture.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Step 2: Season the Chicken</h3>
      <p>
        Season Liberally: While the chicken is still warm, generously season it with salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, or any other preferred spices. Make sure to coat all sides of the chicken pieces evenly.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Step 3: Prepare the Coating</h3>
      <p>
        Mix Flour and Seasonings: In a shallow dish or bowl, combine the all-purpose flour with paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper (if using), salt, and pepper. Mix well to ensure the seasonings are evenly distributed.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Step 4: Coat and Fry the Chicken</h3>
      <p>
        Coat Chicken: Dredge each seasoned chicken piece in the seasoned flour mixture, making sure to coat it thoroughly. Shake off any excess flour.
      </p>
      <p>
        Heat Oil: In a large skillet or frying pan, heat enough vegetable oil over medium-high heat to cover the bottom of the pan.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fry Chicken: Carefully place the coated chicken pieces in the hot oil, skin side down if using skin-on pieces. Fry in batches if necessary, making sure not to overcrowd the pan. Fry each side for about 5-7 minutes, or until golden brown and crispy. Use tongs to turn the chicken pieces occasionally to ensure even cooking.
      </p>
      <p>
        Drain and Rest: Once cooked, transfer the fried chicken pieces to a wire rack or paper towels to drain excess oil. Let them rest for a few minutes before serving.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Step 5: Serve</h3>
      <p>
        Enjoy: Serve your homemade fried chicken hot and crispy! It pairs well with mashed potatoes, coleslaw, biscuits, or your favorite sides.
