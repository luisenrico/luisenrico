    <h1>How to Make Spaghetti with Tomato Sauce: A Step-by-Step Guide</h1>
    <p>Spaghetti is a classic Italian pasta dish loved for its simplicity and versatility. Whether you prefer it with a rich tomato sauce, a creamy Alfredo sauce, or a meaty Bolognese, spaghetti is a comforting and delicious meal. In this blog post, I’ll guide you through making spaghetti with a classic tomato sauce step by step.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <div class="ingredients">
        <ul>
            <li>For the Spaghetti:</li>
            <li>8 ounces (about 225g) spaghetti pasta</li>
            <li>Salt for boiling water</li>
            <li>For the Tomato Sauce:</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 (14-ounce/400g) can diced tomatoes (or use fresh tomatoes, peeled and chopped)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional, for heat)</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Fresh basil or parsley, chopped (for garnish)</li>
            <li>Grated Parmesan cheese (optional, for serving)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Step 1: Cook the Spaghetti</h2>
    <div class="steps">
        <ul>
            <li>Boil Water: Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil.</li>
            <li>Add Spaghetti: Add the spaghetti pasta to the boiling water. Cook according to the package instructions until al dente, usually about 8-10 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.</li>
            <li>Drain Pasta: Once the spaghetti is cooked, drain it in a colander. Reserve about 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water for later use.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Step 2: Prepare the Tomato Sauce</h2>
    <div class="steps">
        <ul>
            <li>Sauté Aromatics: In a large skillet or saucepan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté for 3-4 minutes until softened and translucent. Add the minced garlic and cook for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add Tomatoes and Seasonings: Pour in the diced tomatoes (with their juices) into the skillet. Add dried oregano, dried basil, red pepper flakes (if using), salt, and pepper. Stir well to combine.</li>
            <li>Simmer Sauce: Bring the tomato sauce to a gentle simmer. Let it cook for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens and the flavors meld together. If the sauce becomes too thick, you can add a splash of the reserved pasta cooking water to loosen it.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Step 3: Combine Spaghetti and Sauce</h2>
    <div class="steps">
        <ul>
            <li>Add Spaghetti to Sauce: Add the cooked and drained spaghetti to the skillet with the tomato sauce. Toss gently to coat the pasta evenly with the sauce. If needed, add more pasta cooking water to adjust the consistency.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Step 4: Serve</h2>
    <div class="steps">
        <ul>
            <li>Plate and Garnish: Divide the spaghetti among serving plates or bowls. Garnish with chopped fresh basil or parsley.</li>
            <li>Add Cheese (Optional): Serve with grated Parmesan cheese on the side for sprinkling over the pasta.</li>
            <li>Enjoy: Serve immediately and enjoy your homemade spaghetti with tomato sauce!</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p>Making spaghetti with tomato sauce is a simple yet delicious meal that can be enjoyed any day of the week. Follow these steps, and you’ll have a classic Italian dish that’s sure to satisfy. Buon appetito!</p>
