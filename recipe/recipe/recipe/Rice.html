    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <div class="ingredients">
        <ul>
            <li>Main Ingredients:</li>
            <li>3 cups cooked rice (preferably leftover and cooled)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil or sesame oil</li>
            <li>2 eggs, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>1 cup mixed vegetables (such as diced carrots, peas, and corn)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup diced onion</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1/2 cup diced cooked meat (such as chicken, shrimp, or ham) - optional</li>
            <li>Soy sauce, to taste</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>Green onions (scallions), chopped, for garnish</li>
            <li>Optional Add-ins:</li>
            <li>1/2 cup diced bell peppers</li>
            <li>1/2 cup bean sprouts</li>
            <li>1/2 cup cooked diced tofu</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chopped cooked bacon</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Step 1: Prepare the Ingredients</h2>
    <div class="steps">
        <ul>
            <li>Cook Rice: If you don't have leftover rice, cook 1 cup of rice according to package instructions. Let it cool completely before using it to make fried rice. Cold rice works best for frying.</li>
            <li>Prepare Vegetables and Meat: Dice all vegetables and any cooked meat you plan to use. Keep them ready for cooking.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Step 2: Cook the Eggs</h2>
    <div class="steps">
        <ul>
            <li>Heat Oil: Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil or sesame oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Cook Eggs: Pour the beaten eggs into the hot skillet. Let them cook undisturbed for a few seconds until they begin to set around the edges. Gently scramble the eggs until cooked through but still slightly soft. Remove the scrambled eggs from the skillet and set aside.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Step 3: Sauté Vegetables and Meat</h2>
    <div class="steps">
        <ul>
            <li>Add Oil: In the same skillet or wok, add another tablespoon of vegetable oil or sesame oil if needed.</li>
            <li>Sauté Aromatics: Add diced onion and minced garlic to the skillet. Sauté for 2-3 minutes until the onion becomes translucent and garlic is fragrant.</li>
            <li>Cook Vegetables: Add mixed vegetables (and any optional vegetables) to the skillet. Stir-fry for about 3-4 minutes until they are tender-crisp. If using cooked meat, add it to the skillet and cook until heated through.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Step 4: Fry the Rice</h2>
    <div class="steps">
        <ul>
            <li>Add Rice: Add the cooked rice to the skillet with the vegetables and meat. Break up any clumps of rice with a spatula or wooden spoon.</li>
            <li>Season: Drizzle soy sauce over the rice mixture, starting with a few tablespoons and adjusting to taste. Season with salt and pepper as needed.</li>
            <li>Stir-Fry: Stir-fry everything together, combining the rice with the vegetables, meat, and eggs. Cook for another 5-7 minutes, stirring frequently, until the rice is heated through and begins to lightly brown.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Step 5: Garnish and Serve</h2>
    <div class="steps">
        <ul>
            <li>Garnish: Stir in the scrambled eggs and chopped green onions (scallions). Mix well to distribute evenly.</li>
            <li>Serve: Transfer the fried rice to serving plates or bowls. Garnish with additional chopped green onions if desired. Serve hot as a main dish or side dish.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
