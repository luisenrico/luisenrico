## Github Pages hosting personal website

| In our school we were thought about front-end, back-end, JavaScript frameworks, SEO fundamentals, Vercel, React and so on. 

Github pages has its ups and down, such as its limitation - GitHub Pages is not intended for or allowed to be used as a free web-hosting service to run your online business, e-commerce site, or any other website that is primarily directed at either facilitating commercial transactions or providing commercial software as a service (SaaS). BUT one can do https://pages.cloudflare.com/ to solve this.


Whereas, for me i only need static hosting, i intend for this be a request and return file. not much need to process.
