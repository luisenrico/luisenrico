## Mirrors how engineers design reliable systems: fewer moving parts, fewer failure modes.

| In our school we were thought about front-end, back-end, JavaScript frameworks, SEO fundamentals, Vercel, React and so on. 

Github pages has its ups and down, such as its limitation - GitHub Pages is not intended for or allowed to be used as a free web-hosting service to run your online business, e-commerce site, or any other website that is primarily directed at either facilitating commercial transactions or providing commercial software as a service (SaaS). BUT one can do https://pages.cloudflare.com/ to solve this.

But I kind of like it this way, because:
1. Fast to load and easy to host
2. Readable and modifiable without frameworks
3. Content-first rather than UI-heav





# Steps

1. Create a Repository: Name it username.github.io, replacing username with your GitHub username.


2. Add Your Website Files: Include an index.html file and any other necessary assets.


3. Publish with GitHub Pages: Navigate to the repository's settings, select the "Pages" section, and choose the main branch as the source.
