## Github Pages hosting personal website

| interestingly, i only need HTML and CSS, and 0 frameworks to make this simple responsive website.

Github pages has its ups and down, such as its limitation - GitHub Pages is not intended for or allowed to be used as a free web-hosting service to run your online business, e-commerce site, or any other website that is primarily directed at either facilitating commercial transactions or providing commercial software as a service (SaaS). BUT one can do https://pages.cloudflare.com/ to solve this.


Whereas, for me i only need static hosting, i intend for this be a request and return file. not much need to process.
