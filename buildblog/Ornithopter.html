  <!-- Context -->
  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    An ornithopter is a flying device that mimics the flight of birds. At face value, the concept is simple; in practice, it is anything but. Unlike fixed-wing aircraft, an ornithopter generates lift and thrust through the periodic flapping of its wings, closely replicating the biomechanics observed in nature. This makes it an ideal engineering problem—deceptively straightforward in description, yet mechanically and analytically complex in execution.

    This project serves as a practical engineering challenge that bridges theory and application. It demands an understanding of aerodynamics, kinematics, structural mechanics, and energy transfer, all working in concert. Designing an ornithopter from scratch requires reasoning from first principles rather than relying solely on empirical replication.
    
    It is well known that numerous ornithopter designs are readily available online. Hobbyists have refined workable configurations for decades, and public demonstrations—such as early <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg_JcKSHUtQ&t=193s"> TED Talks </a>  showcasing flapping-wing flight—clearly prove that the concept works. 
  
  <div class="note">
    <strong>However!</strong>
    this blog is not about copying an existing design. Instead, it focuses on what happens under the hood: the assumptions, trade-offs, and physical constraints that govern flapping-wing flight.
  </div>  
    Interestingly, ornithopters remain popular among hobbyists due to their versatility in material selection and mechanical layouts. This flexibility, however, often masks the underlying complexity of the system.

  <!-- Assumptions -->
  <h2 id="assumptions">2. Assumptions and Constraints</h2>

  <div class="note">
    <strong>Engineering Assumption:</strong>
    The wings are modeled as rigid flat plates with no active twist control.
    This simplifies the mechanism but underestimates aerodynamic efficiency.
  </div>

  <ul>
    <li>Total mass target: &lt; 250 g</li>
    <li>Single motor, no gearbox</li>
    <li>Indoor flight envelope</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- Build -->
  <h2 id="build">3. Build and Implementation</h2>

  <p>
    The flapping mechanism uses a crank-slider driven directly by a brushed
    DC motor. Wing spars are carbon rods with heat-shrink skin.

  <!-- Analysis -->
  <h2 id="analysis">4. Analysis and Observations</h2>

  <p>
    At peak motor speed, the flapping frequency reached approximately 6 Hz.
    Significant torsional oscillation was observed in the wing spars,
    indicating under-designed stiffness.
  </p>

  <div class="note">
    <strong>Key Insight:</strong>
    Structural compliance dominated aerodynamic effects, masking any lift
    gains from increased flapping frequency.
  </div>

  <!-- Results -->
  <h2 id="results">5. Results</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Short hops achieved (&lt; 1 second)</li>
    <li>No sustained flight</li>
    <li>Mechanism reliability acceptable</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- Lessons -->
  <h2 id="lessons">6. Lessons Learned and Next Steps</h2>

  <p>
    Future iterations will prioritize wing torsional stiffness and introduce
    passive twist via compliant joints rather than rigid spars.
